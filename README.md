# Pokémon Catcher 

In this application, users will be able to signup/login. Then they will be redirected to the home page where its a small Pokédex function. 
The Catch Page will allow you to press a button called "Throw Pokéball" that will allow you to save the Pokémon in the user database.
There will be a nav bar to browse through the routes.

# ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

For this application I have used: 

Mongoose for the DB
React
React-Redux
Axios

# PLANS

I plan to make the "Throw Pokéball" button to have animations to catch the fetched Pokémon. Also need to add catch percentages.

I also need to update and tweak plenty of things for the Login/SignUp page.

I plan to add a inventory for the caught Pokémon and make it look list of Pokémon with the data for each user because what I've been trying at the moment hasn't been working.

# What I've Learned

I learned to never use react + react-redux together because it can confuse the crap out of you.
Also mongodb + mongoose

JUST ONE OR THE OTHER SO YOU DONT GET CONFUSED!!!
