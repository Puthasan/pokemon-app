# POKEMON CATCHER 

In this application, users will be able to signup/login. Then they will be redirected to the home page where its a small pokedex function. 
The Catch Page will allow you to press a button called "Throw Pokeball" that will allow you to save the pokemon in the user database.
There will be a nav bar to browse through the routes.

# ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

For this application I have used: 

Mongoose for the DB
React
React-Redux
Axios

# PLANS

I plan to make the "Throw Pokeball" button to have animations to catch the fetched pokemon. Also need to add catch percentages.

I also need to update and tweak plenty of things for the Login/SignUp page.

i plan to add a inventory for the caught pokemon and make it look list of pokemon with the data for each user.

# What I've Learned

I learned to never use react + react-redux together because it can confuse the crap out of you.
Also mongodb + mongoose

JUST ONE OR THE OTHER SO YOU DONT GET CONFUSED!!!
